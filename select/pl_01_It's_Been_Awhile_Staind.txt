and it's been awhile
since I could hold
my head up high
and it's been awhile
since I first saw you
and it's been awhile
since I could stand
on my own two feet again
and it's been awhile
since I could call you
and everything
I can't remember
as fucked up as it
all may seem
the consequences
that I've rendered
I've stretched myself
beyond my means
it's been awhile
since I can say
that I wasn't addicted
and it's been awhile
since I can say I love
myself as well and
and it's been awhile
since I've gone and fucked
things up just like I always do
and it's been awhile
but all that shit seems to
disappear when I'm with you
and everything
I can't remember
as fucked up as
it all may seem
the consequences
that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked
things up again
why must I feel this way
just make this go away
just one more peaceful day
and it's been awhile
since I could look at
myself straight
and it's been awhile
since I said I'm sorry
and it's been awhile
since I've seen the way
the candles light your face
and it's been awhile
but I can still remember
just the way you taste
and everything
I can't remember
as fucked up as it
all may seem to be
I know it's me
I cannot blame
this on my father
he did the best
he could for me
and it's been awhile
since I could hold
my head up high
and it's ben awhile
since I said I'm sorry
